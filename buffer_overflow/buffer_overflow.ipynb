    "    - Arrange the panes into a somewhat sane configuration. For example, the instructions and one terminal top/bottom on the left, the second terminal on the right.\n",
    "    - You'll want one of the terminals to be as large as possible because this is where we'll be using GDB.\n",
    "    - If you have multiple monitors, now is a great time to open another Jupyterlab instance on another monitor for more real estate.\n",
    "- Navigate both terminals to `/host/courses/embsec/embsec_student/lessons/buffer_overflow`\n",
    "- In the small terminal, launch the binary in debug mode in QEMU with `debug-arm-user ./target`\n",

    "### Useful GDB commands:\n",
    "- `break functionName`: Set a breakpoint at the beginning of a function\n",
    "    - `break *0x1337` to set a breakpoint at a specific address\n",
    "- `info break`: View currently set breakpoints\n",
    "- `delete 2`: Delete breakpoint 2 (Numbers shown in `info break`)\n",
    "    - `delete`: Delete all breakpoints\n",
    "- `continue`: Run program until the next breakpoint\n",
    "- `si` (step instruction): Step forward one assembly instruction, stepping into function calls\n",
    "- `ni` (next instruction): Step forward one assembly instruction, stepping over function calls\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print functionName`: Print information about a function, including its address\n",
    "- `info frame`: Get information on the current and previous stack frames\n",
    "- `up`: Move view up one level in the call stack without changing execution state\n",
    "- `down`: Move view down one level in the call stack without changing execution state\n",
    "- `inspect variableName`: View the contents of a variable\n",
    "    - `inspect &variableName` to view the variable's address\n",
    "- `x/64bx 0x1337`: Display 64 bytes of memory starting at address 0x1337\n",
    "    - First `x` means eXamine memory\n",
    "    - 64 is length, 0x1337 is address (these can of course be whatever you want)\n",
    "    - `b` specifies unit size of a byte.\n",
    "        - `h`: halfword (2 bytes)\n",
    "        - `w`: word (4 bytes)\n",
    "    - second `x` specifies to print data in hexadecimal rather than the default format: decimal\n",
    "\n",
    "- `disass functionName`: Jump disassembly view to a function\n",
    "- `refresh`: Sometimes the screen will get a little wonky in GDB. This will reset the interface to how it's supposed to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing hex values into stdin:\n",
    "- `echo -ne \"\\xab\\xcd\" | ./target`: Send two raw bytes (ab, cd) to the binary.\n",
